Noroff's "JavaScript 1". The assignment is to build an interactive store in HTML, CSS and JavaScript (only) using an API. The goal behind the assignment is to 'incrementally learn' the core/fundamental technologies of frontend development.

Features:

- API-driven product list
- Genre filter
- Product detail
- Cart (localStorage)
- Checkout summary
- Order confirmation

More adjustments and improvements will be made over time.

To run: Open `index.html` with a local server (VS Code Live Server).
